.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way,
based upon problem statement, quality goals and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-4/[Solution Strategy] in the arc42 documentation.

There are some placeholders for the decisions yet to be taken.

=== Technological Decisions
* Programming Language: Java will be used for system development because all team members are familiar with it, and we believe we can perform better using this language.
* Frontend Framework: SpringBoot will be adopted for frontend development because it allows us to deploy a web application using Java and provides numerous functionalities that greatly facilitate the implementation of project requirements, such as user authentication.
* Database: [Database] was selected as the storage engine due to [reasons].

=== System Decomposition
The Model-View-Controler architecture pattern will be followed for structuring the system, dividing it into modules/classes responsible for the managment of the players, questions, answers and game, and the viiews of the frontend.

=== Quality Goals
* Performance: A quick system response will be sought, especially during question generation and gameplay.
* Security: Security measures will be implemented to protect user information and ensure the integrity of generated questions.

=== Organizational Decisions
Development Methodology: GitFlow will be adopted for project management, facilitating collaboration and iterative delivery.
