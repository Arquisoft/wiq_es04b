|Identification |Scenario

| SC1
| Users expect the application to load quickly and respond promptly to their interactions, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.

| SC2
| The application's user interface is designed intuitively, allowing users to navigate effortlessly and find what they need without confusion or frustration.

| SC3
| Developers can easily add new features or modify existing ones without disrupting the overall functionality of the application, ensuring its long-term maintainability.

| SC4
| Users rely on the application to be available whenever they want to play, and the system ensures a high level of uptime, minimizing downtime for maintenance or updates.

| SC5
| Whether accessed from a desktop computer or a mobile device, users expect the application to adapt seamlessly to their screen size and input method, providing a consistent experience across platforms.

| SC6
| The testing process is streamlined, allowing QA teams to efficiently create, execute, and analyze test cases, ensuring the reliability and stability of the application.

| SC7
| As user demand grows, the deployment does not grow dynamically. However a system can be put in place to deploy more instances of the application to handle the increased workload, trough a load balancer, for example.
