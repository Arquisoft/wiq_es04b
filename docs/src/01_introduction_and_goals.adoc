== Introduction and Goals
This web application, inspired by the famous Spanish TV show "Saber y ganar," consists of a mini-game of questions and answers.
In this game, the player is asked a question and presented with four possible answers, of which only one is correct.

* The player must register with a name.
* The player must answer the question within a time limit.
* If the player does not answer, it will be counted as an incorrect response.
* Each correct answer earns points.
* Optionally, the score can be saved in a ranking.

For all those "Saber y ganar" viewers who wanted to participate in the show, this application is ideal for testing their knowledge.

The application automatically generates questions with the help of Wikidata (the page that supports Wikipedia and many other wikis) 
to constantly update the questions instead of storing them in a database.
