== Deployment View

The deployment strategy for our game, which leverages the Wikidata API to dynamically generate questions, is built around a Docker-based infrastructure. This approach allows for the encapsulation of our Java Spring Boot application within a Docker container, simplifying deployments across different environments (development, testing, and production) while ensuring consistency and isolation.

=== Infrastructure Level 1

Our application is containerized using Docker, enabling us to deploy the entire stack as a single `.jar` file that includes the web server. This method ensures that our application can be easily moved across environments or scaled up as needed without significant changes to the infrastructure.

_**Overview Diagram:**_
The infrastructure features a single Docker container that hosts the Java Spring Boot application. This container communicates with external services, such as the Wikidata API, to fetch data in real-time and generate game questions.

.Motivation
The primary motivation behind using Docker for deployment is to streamline the development and deployment processes. By containerizing the application, we reduce discrepancies between environments, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy with confidence.

.Quality and/or Performance Features
- **Portability:** Docker containers can run on any system that has Docker installed, reducing environment-specific bugs.
- **Scalability:** While we start with a single container, the setup can be easily scaled using Docker Compose or Docker Swarm if the need arises.
- **Efficiency:** Docker utilizes resources more efficiently than traditional VMs, allowing for faster startup times and lower overhead.

.Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure
- **Web Server/Application (.jar file):** Packaged within a Docker container, it includes all necessary dependencies to run independently across any Docker-supported platform.
- **External APIs (e.g., Wikidata API):** Accessed over the network, these APIs provide dynamic content for the game.
- **Grafana**: Monitoring tool that can be used to visualize and analyze metrics from the application and infrastructure.
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring tool that collects metrics from the application and infrastructure for Grafana to visualize.

=== Infrastructure Level 2

At this level, we describe the Docker container configuration that encapsulates our application.

==== _Docker Container_

Our app's Docker container is built from a Java base image, which is then layered with our applicationâ€™s `.jar` file.

In addition to the Spring boot standalone file, we also use the official `MySQL` server docker container image brought by DockerHub. This is our database server and it is used to store the game data, such as user scores, questions, etc. and all the other persistent data.

Moreover, there are two more containers. These are the monitoring tools, `Prometheus` and `Grafana`. These tools are used to monitor the application and infrastructure. Prometheus collects metrics from the application and infrastructure, while Grafana visualizes these metrics.

This setup encapsulates the entire runtime environment required for our application, and does not require extensive configuration.

.Explanation:
This diagram illustrates the internal structure of our Docker containers structure. It shows the Java Spring Boot application, including the embedded web server, packaged as a `.jar` file and the MySQL server. The application interacts with external APIs, like the Wikidata API, to retrieve data necessary for generating game questions.
To ensure the application's health and performance, we use Prometheus to collect metrics and Grafana to visualize these metrics.
The containerized approach ensures that the application can be deployed consistently across any environment that supports Docker.
