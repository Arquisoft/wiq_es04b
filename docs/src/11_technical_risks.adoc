== Risks and Technical Debts

| Priority | Risk | Description

| High | Architecture in Spring Boot | The architecture of the project will be based on Spring Boot, which is a framework that we are not that familiar with, or not at all for some members. This could lead to a delay in the development of the project.
| Medium | Wikidata | The project will use Wikidata as a source of data. We have never used Wikidata before, so we will have to learn how to use it.
| Medium | IDE Configuration | Version compatibility, extensions and other preferences to work perfectly without conflicts
| Medium | Docker  | Know how docker works, what it is for, how it is used and what its alternatives could be.
| Low | Database | The database decision will not be taken based on what technology we know better, but on what is best for the project. Usage of JPA, Hibernate allows us to focus on the business logic and not on the database.

| Priority | Debt | Description

| Medium | Documentation | The documentation of the project will be done in parallel with the development of the project. This could lead to a delay in the development of the project.
| Medium | Testing | The project will have unit and integration tests, we ensure tests cover the majority of the code. However due to time constraints and how the project is structured, we may not be able to cover all the code with all the possible cases. The aim is to cover at least 80% of the code.
| Low | Code Quality | The code quality will be ensured by the use of SonarCloud, but due to time constraints, we may not be able to fix all the issues that SonarCloud will find.
| Low | Security | The project will have security measures in place. Standard practices are put in place. Tougher security measures will not be implemented due to performance constraints.
