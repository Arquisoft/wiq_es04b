== Building Block View

The Building Block View elaborates on the static structure of the system. It decomposes the system into building blocks like modules, components, subsystems, and others, detailing their responsibilities and relationships.

=== Whitebox Overall System

This section provides an overview of the main components of the system and their interactions. The core of the system is the WIQ (WiqEs04bApplication) component, which interfaces with Users, Wikidata for question generation, a Database for persistence, and offers a REST API for External Developers.

==== Motivation

The decomposition provides a clear, high-level overview of how the WIQ system interacts with users, external services (Wikidata), stores data (Database), and interfaces with external developers through the REST API. This modularity supports scalability and maintainability.

==== Contained Building Blocks

[options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description

| User
| Represents the end users of the WIQ application, interacting with the system to play games and view their history.

| WIQ (WiqEs04bApplication)
| The central component that manages gameplay logic, user interactions, and integrates external data for question generation.

| Wikidata
| An external service utilized by the WIQ system to retrieve data for dynamically generating quiz questions.

| Database
| Maintains persistent storage for user data, game history, and generated questions, ensuring data integrity and availability.

| External Developers
| Developers or systems that interact with the WIQ system via the REST API to access or modify player and question data.

=== Level 2

For Level 2 of the Building Block View, the WIQ (QuestionGame) system is further decomposed into four primary components that define its operational structure. Each component is designed to fulfill specific roles within the architecture, ensuring the system's functionality and responsiveness to user interactions.

* *GameService:* This component acts as the core of the QuestionGame, orchestrating the flow of games, managing question selection, enforcing game rules, and tracking scores. It ensures that gameplay proceeds smoothly and according to the predefined logic, offering a seamless experience for the user.

* *PlayerService:* Responsible for handling user accounts, this component manages registration, authentication, and profile management. It safeguards user data while providing a personalized experience through game history tracking and preference settings.

* *QuestionService:* This component interacts directly with the Wikidata service to fetch data for question generation. It processes and curates content to produce relevant, challenging questions for the game, thereby ensuring a varied and educational experience.

* *RestApiService:* Serving as the gateway for external developers, this component exposes a set of RESTful APIs that allow access to player information and question data. It handles request processing, authentication, and data delivery, facilitating third-party integrations and extensions of the WIQ platform.

=== Level 3

In Level 3, we take a closer look at the API Management component, breaking it down into two essential services: the Player Information API and the Question Information API. These services are fundamental to the system's ability to interact with external applications, providing necessary functionalities with a focus on usability and security.

* *Player Information API:* This API serves as the gateway for external applications to access and manage player data. It allows for operations such as retrieving player profiles, updating personal information, and viewing game history. The design prioritizes data security, ensuring safe and secure access to sensitive information. The interface is straightforward, designed for ease of use while maintaining comprehensive functionality.

* *Question Information API:* Dedicated to the dynamic world of quiz questions, this API facilitates the retrieval of questions and submission of answers. It stands as a bridge between the system's vast question repository and external applications, enabling a seamless flow of information. The API adheres to clear and logical request and response structures, ensuring efficient and effective communication. Security measures are in place to protect the integrity of the question data and the fairness of the game.

This level of documentation provides a structured and clear view of the system's architecture, particularly focusing on its integration points. By balancing formal language with accessibility, we aim to communicate effectively with a broad audience of stakeholders, ensuring understanding and transparency in the system's design.
